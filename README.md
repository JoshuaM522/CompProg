### Calculator (2025)

Description:This program is a graphical calculator built using the Processing language. It features a user-friendly interface with buttons for numbers 0 through 9, basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and advanced functions such as exponentiation, square root, sign inversion, insertion of π, and decimal points. The calculator uses arrays to manage numeric and function/operator buttons, and variables to track the left and right operands, the current operator, and the result. The interface is updated continuously in the `draw()` function, while user interactions are handled through `mousePressed()`, which interprets button clicks and updates the state accordingly. The current value is displayed and dynamically resized based on length to maintain readability. The program supports chaining of operations and includes logic to prevent improper decimal formatting or overflow in the display. Overall, it offers a clean, interactive experience and serves as a solid foundation for building more advanced calculator features.
